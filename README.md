### The Community Update takes the best suggestions from the community that fit into the vanilla game, and compiles them into one mod.

**To suggest a new feature, [click here](https://github.com/ReconCubed/thecommunityupdate/issues) and submit a new issue with the ENHANCEMENT label.**


This mod was originally made for a private server, where I took some of my friends ideas to add in-game. The entire mod has been created with Vanilla in mind at all times, hence why there are no extreme additions.
